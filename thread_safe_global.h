 * A pthread_cfvar_np_t is an object that holds a pointer to what would

 * a thread-safe "configuration variable".  Threads can safely read and
 * write this via pthread_cfvar_get_np() and pthread_cfvar_set_np(),
 * with configuration values destroyed only when the last reference is
 * released.  Applications should store mostly read-only values in a
 * pthread_cfvar_np_t -- typically configuration information, the sort
 * of data that rarely changes.
 *
 * Writes are serialized.  Readers don't block and do not spin, and
 * mostly perform only fast atomic operations; the only blocking
 * operations done by readers are for uncontended resources.
