/*
 * This is an attempt at a MT-hot "current configuration" API with
 * thread-safe updates.  Readers do nothing that blocks except for the
 * last reader when there's a waiting writer, in which case the reader
 * grabs a lock, signals the writer, then drops the lock and goes on its
 * merry way.  This isn't just for configuration though: it could be
 * used for lots of things, such as the global table of string constants
 * in libheimbase (see the HSTR() macro used in libheimbase).
 *
 * This could also be used for a COW approach to global state.  Suppose
 * you want to update something deep in global state, suppose in fact
 * that you have a tree of data using something like libheimbase objects
 * (or Core Foundation objects), and you want to update a leaf object
 * using an XPath-like API.  But this being global state means you need
 * synchronization.  If the XPath-like API includes a COW version that
 * returns a new root then you can just use this API here to replace the
 * global root.
 *
 * This is a better interface than reader/writer locks.  There can be no
 * writer starvation.  Readers mostly do not block.  Only the last
 * reader of a given version of configuration data can block, and only
 * at times when there are two or more writes in quick succession.
 * And such a reader it will wait only for the one active writer, if
 * there is one.
 *
 * If multiple readers race with a writer some may get the configuration
 * data that was in effect before the writer updates it, and some may
 * get the configuration data that the writer sets.  But once a writer
 * is [almost] finished then all readers will get the new configuration
 * data until the next writer comes along.
 *
 * See Doxygen comments below for API details.
 *
 * There is no guarantee that by the time the 'set' function returns all
 * other threads are using the new configuration data.  The caller may
 * arrange to obtain such guarantees by acquiring a mutex before calling
 * the 'set' funciton then blocking on a condition variable that will be
 * signaled by the last reference release of the previous configuration.
 * The caller may need to arrange to wake up all threads (e.g., that are
 * waiting in an event loop) in order to make such a synchronization
 * mechanism timely.
 *
 * The way this works is that the cfvar holds two versions of
 * configuration data.  Readers will always get the newest version.
 * Writers replace what used to be the oldest version.  See the struct
 * definition below this comment block, then the algorithm immediately
 * below:
 *
 * To set a new ptr for a pthread_cfvar_np_t variable named foo we:
 *   acquire foo->write_lock; (exclude other writers)
 *   acquire foo->cv_lock; (used for waiting for last reader of old config)
 *   atomic increment foo->writer;
 *
 *   find x such that foo->vers[x].vers < foo->vers[(x + 1) % 2].vers;
 *   old_ptr = foo->vers[x].ptr;
 *   foo->vers[x].ptr = new_ptr;
 *   foo->vers[x].vers = foo->vers[(x + 1) % 2].vers + 1;
 *   producer membar;
 *   while foo->vers[(x + 1) % 2].readers > 0
 *     cond_wait(foo->cv, foo->cv_lock);
 *   atomic decrement foo->writer;
 *   release foo->cv_lock;
 *   release foo->write_lock;
 *   foo->put_ref(old_ptr);
 *   return;
 *
 * To get the newest available ptr from foo:
 *   atomic increment foo->vers[0].readers;
 *   atomic increment foo->vers[1].readers;
 *   membar_consumer;
 *   find x such that foo->vers[x].vers > foo->vers[(x + 1) % 2].vers;
 *   atomic decrement foo->[(x + 1) % 2].readers;
 *   ptr = foo->vers[x].ptr;
 *   foo->get_ref(ptr);
 *   if (atomic decrement foo->[x].readers now zero &&
 *       atomic_read(foo->writer)
 *     membar_consumer;
 *     acquire foo->cv_lock; (if racing with a writer this is where we
 *                            serialize w.r.t. them)
 *     cond_signal(foo->cv); (if there's no writer waiting, no sweat)
 *     drop foo->cv_lock;
 *   return ptr;
 *
 * Note that no writer starvation is possible because the last reader of
 * an old configuration data version will notice that it is the last
 * reader, and will signal the waiting writer, and new readers will be
 * getting the new version if they start after the writer updates the
 * new version, thus new readers can't block the waiting writer.
 * Writers only ever block on the last reader of the old configuration.
 * Why would there be a reader getting the old config?  Well, 
 *
 * Note that readers can notice a version change that happened after
 * their selection of a version; readers could re-start to get the new
 * version, but this might cause problems (e.g., readers never finishing
 * because of a constant stream of writers).
 *
 * What's missing?  Ah, we need to pthread_cancel_push/pop() around the
 * bodies of the get and set functions so that we can avoid leaving
 * cfvars in bad state, or leak references to cf data when the thread
 * gets cancelled.  The caller is responsible for doing the same to
 * avoid leaking references to cf data, but most apps don't bother with
 * this -- we have to because we aim to be a library utility.
