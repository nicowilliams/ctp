/*
 * This implements a thread-safe variable.  A thread can read it, and the
 * value it reads will be safe to use until it reads it again.
 *
 * Properties:
 *
 *  - writers are serialized
 *  - readers are fast, rarely doing blocking operations, and when they
 *    do, not blocking on contended resources
 *  - readers do not starve writers; writers do not block readers
 *
 * The design for this implementation uses a pair of slots such that one
 * has a current value for the variable, and the other holds the
 * previous value and will hold the next value.
 *
 * An alternative design could have each thread "subscribe" a pair of
 * slots for itself and have the writers "publish" to each subscribed
 * thread.  The subsciption would require taking a lock once per-reader.
 * The publish operation would be very fast, and the read operation
 * would be very fast as well.  The read operation would consist of
 * checking if the not-current slot has a newer value, and if so
 * atomically change a current slot pointer, while the writer would
 * write to the current slot's other slot pointer.  This alternative
 * might be significantly simpler than the current design, though
 * writing becomes O(N), but then, writing would not block on any
 * readers.  Though maybe it wouldn't be simpler: it seems the atomic
 * composition issues in the current design would still remain.
 */
/*
 * There are several atomic compositions needed to make this work.
 *
 *  - writers have to write two things (a pointer to a struct wrapping
 *    the intended value, and a version number)
 *
 *  - readers have to atomically read a version number, a pointer, and
 *    increment a ref count.
 *
 * These compositions are the challenging part of this.
 *
 * In a way this structure is a lot like a read-write lock that doesn't
 * starve writers.  But since the only thing readers here do with a
 * would-be read-write lock held is grab a reference to a "current"
 * value, this construction can be faster than read-write locks without
 * writer starvation: readers (almost) *never* block on contended
 * resources.  We achieve this by having two value slots: one for the
 * current value, and one for the previous/next value.  Readers can
 * always lock-less-ly find one of the two values.
 *
 * Whereas in the case of a read-write lock without writer starvation,
 * readers arriving after a writer must get held up for the writer who,
 * in turn, is held up by readers.  Therefore, for the typical case
 * where one uses read-write locks (to mediate access to rarely-changing
 * mostly-read-only "configuration"), the API implemented here is
 * superior to read-write locks.
 *
 * We often use atomic CAS with equal new and old values as an atomic
 * read.  We could do better though.  We could use a LoadStore fence
 * around reads instead.
 *
 * NOTE WELL: We assume that atomic operations imply memory barriers.
 *
 *            The general rule is that all things which are to be
 *            atomically modified in some cases are always modified
 *            atomically, except at initialization time, and even then,
 *            in some cases the initialized value is immediately
 *            modified with an atomic operation.  This is to ensure
 *            memory visibility rules (see above), though we may be
 *            trying much too hard in some cases.
 *
 *            We could probably make this code more efficient using
 *            explicit acquire/release membars and fewer CASes, on some
 *            CPUs anyways.  But this should already be quite a lot
 *            faster for readers than using read-write locks, and a much
 *            more convenient and natural API to boot.
 *
 *            In any case: first make it work, then optimize.
